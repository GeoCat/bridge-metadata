A conversion utility to convert ISO 19139 metadata to Ecological Metadata Language (EML) format.

Initially the conversion will be incomplete, but extensions and contributions welcome.

This utility only converts from ISO 19139 to EML.  The reverse translation, from EML to ISO 19139, was worked on by GBIF, and the XSLT is accessible (https://github.com/gbif/eml-profile/blob/master/eml2iso19139.xsl).  There may have been extensions of thie by INSPIRE and maybe LTER, but I'm unsure where to find them.
